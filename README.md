# yclimate
A fork of zclimate but for use with the ycashd internal wallet.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION! YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE THIS RIGHT NOW!
Also I found a bug wrt a hardcoded directory. It's only 2 instances but yeah nogo.

TODO ADD BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
In the meantime, you could just follow the zclimate build. 
It's all the same except everything zcash is ycash.
That was the initial fix and it worked for getinfo! 
However it's not up to par, requires changes for some non-compatible 
calls and other stuff, hence don't use right now.
